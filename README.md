# RTAD5G: Real-Time Multivariate Anomaly Detection Systems in Industry’s 5G Networks: A Comprehensive Workflow

This thesis presents a detailed exploration of real-time anomaly detection in the complex environment of 5G networks. Conducted at Sapienza University of Rome in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), the project addresses the challenges of identifying anomalies in high-dimensional, weakly correlated, and unlabeled multivariate time series data typical in 5G networks.

The research introduces a robust workflow encompassing data gathering, preprocessing, clustering, labeling, and real-time model building using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes a novel model selection process based on multiple criteria such as correctness, time performance, and resource consumption. To ensure transparency, the thesis also integrates advanced model explainability methods like SHAP and LIME. This project’s significance is highlighted by its recognition in the CTG Hackathon and the Best-Paper Award at HPE.

#### Summary Description
Working within the ranks of Path Finder, a distinguished Research Team at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), I engaged in groundbreaking research focused on Multivariate Anomaly Detection Analysis within the context of 5G Networks’ Time Series data. 
- Spearheaded the conception and realization of a Customer-Centered and Customer-Agnostic Multivariate Anomaly Detection Comprehensive Workflow. This intricate process commences with the integration of the Customer’s Network Data, culminating in the pinpointing of pivotal Features contributing to anomaly identification.
- Successfully validated the efficacy of the devised Workflow through meticulous experimentation with a prominent Customer. The outcomes eclipsed prior solutions, with astonishing improvements in the Number of Models to train and maintain, in the Time and Resources Requirements that have experienced a huge cut both at Design and Inference Time, maintaining impressive Overall Metrics Performances.


#### Successes & Achievements
- Attained an Honourable Mention distinction in an internal Hackathon hosted by HPE, during which I presented the aforementioned Workflow, garnering recognition for its innovation and practicality.
- Acclaimed, as a group achievement, with the esteemed Best HPE Paper Award, underscoring the exceptional quality and significance of the team’s contributions to the research and development initiatives.
