### Building Real-Time Multivariate Anomaly Detection Systems in Industry’s 5G Networks: A Comprehensive Workflow

# Summary Description
Working within the ranks of Path Finder, a distinguished Research Team at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), I engaged in groundbreaking research focused on Multivariate Anomaly Detection Analysis within the context of 5G Networks’ Time Series data. 
- Spearheaded the conception and realization of a Customer-Centered and Customer-Agnostic Multivariate Anomaly Detection Comprehensive Workflow. This intricate process commences with the integration of the Customer’s Network Data, culminating in the pinpointing of pivotal Features contributing to anomaly identification.
– Successfully validated the efficacy of the devised Workflow through meticulous experimentation with a prominent Customer. The outcomes eclipsed prior solutions, with astonishing improvements in the Number of Models to train and maintain, in the Time and Resources Requirements that have experienced a huge cut both at Design and Inference Time, maintaining impressive Overall Metrics Performances.


# Successes & Achievements
– Attained an $$Honourable Mention$$ distinction in an internal Hackathon hosted by HPE, during which I presented the aforementioned Workflow, garnering recognition for its innovation and practicality.
– Acclaimed, as a group achievement, with the esteemed Best HPE Paper Award, underscoring the exceptional quality and significance of the team’s contributions to the research and development initiatives.
